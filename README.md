# Wiki Encyclopedia

A Wikipedia-like online encyclopedia that allows you to search for, edit and create new entries, as well as requesting a random entry page.


## Design Document Information

**For this project, 5 to 6 HTML pages are required:**
1. A homepage
2. A page which loads the title and text of an entry 
3. A search page which shows the suggested entries based on a search query
4. A page to make a new entry
5. A page that allows to user to edit an entry
6. An error page when typing in an URL that does not exist

*Page 2 and 6 may potentially be the same HTML file. If the user types in a title that does not exist the error page will be loaded, otherwise the entry page will be loaded*

**When a new page is added, which files need to be changed?**
- A markdown file called newtitle.md should be added to /entries/
